A man must not show weakness. A man must be as strong and immoveable as a rock.

A stone built with a rock that crumbs under pressure compromises the foundation of the home it is built with. It does not matter how pretty, how beautiful, how large, how shiny, or how well-shaped the rock is. All that matters if it does not crumble.

A home may be filled with many shiny things. Things that have inherit value because of their beautify. And these objects are meant to degrade and crumble over time. They will be maintained and they will be repaired further and further each time, as we value these things.

A rock, once it crumbles, is worth nothing.

If a rock crumbles it may be repurposed. It may be used in grout, to support other stronger rocks. It may be used to build a smaller home filled with fewer shiny, beautiful things. It may turn into sand, and be the very thing other rocks try to keep out.

A rock may have been very strong once. And it was prized for its strength. But a rock is only as valuable as the last home it kept together, and the last time it crumbled.

Only a rock understands the strength a rock must face. Sand will empathise with the rock, knowing that it too was once a rock that held up many buildings. A rock amongst sand will smoothen and polish over time, and be prized for its beauty. But it will never hold up a home again.

Rocks may lean on each other for strength. Many rocks arranged together for strength may support a home, a city, and a temple. But a rock must not lean on a shiny, beautiful thing. For its rawness and strength will only damage that beautiful thing. 

A rock, once it crumbles, is worth nothing.
