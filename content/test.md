Hello, world! 

It has been a recent goal of mine to start to unload a few more of my thoughts.
It's very easy to get caught up in the day-to-day of life and never stop to 
write down all of the wisdom you accumulate over time. 

I hope that this blog will become a sink for everything going on in my mind:
coding tricks and techniques I learn, random thoughts from my walks, and 
experiences that I think would be selfish for me to keep to myself.

I hope that not only do I look at this blog and become proud of the work I
put in, but you too are able to take something away from it of value.
